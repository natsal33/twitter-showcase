## Summary

This expense tracker was implemented using React, React-Bootstrap, Javascript and is deployed using Heroku. The tracker has 5 inputs: a date picker, a category dropdown selector, and three text inputs for vendor, description, and amount. When all 5 inputs have a value, the user can press "submit" and an expense line will be added to the "Expense Log" table below. The user can also click on any expense in the table, and it will be deleted.

This app also utilizes local storage for both the expense items and the inputs. This way, not only can the user be reassured that their expenses will still be there when they refresh or navigate back to the app, but their inputs will be stored as well if their session was interrupted.
